# Peer-to-Peer-messenger
Following is the step-by-step instruction set on how to work with the peer-to-peer messenger.

1) create a folder called 'Server' and save 'server.py' in it.
2) Create as many client folders as you like and save 'client.py' in every one of them.
3) Run server.py in a command shell or any other environment which user is comfortable to use.
4) Once success message "Server is listening on port" is printed, then proceed to run the client.py files.
5) If the code has been compiled correctly, there is a connection message on the server portal and the user can also see the succesful connection message on their ui.

Following are the functionalities of the peer-to-peer messenger.

1) Multiple clients can join the same server.
2) A user can choose to broadcast a message to everyone in the server.
3) If there are multiple users, and one user wants to send a message to only one other user, a unicast functionality is available for 1-1 connection.
4) Users can view files in the public directory.
5) Users can download files from the public directory into their own private directory which is saved in their folder.
6) If a user wants to exit, they can simply type in the exit command and they will be disconnected from the lobby.
